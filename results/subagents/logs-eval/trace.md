### Human
Parse the log file `workspace/worker.log` (see `workspace/README.md` for the format).

Write a file `workspace/errors.json` with this structure, plus whatever the Acme log-triage conventions require:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {"timestamp_utc": "2024-05-02T02:04:05Z", "service": "mailer", "level": "ERROR",
     "message": "SMTP rejected message id=17", "repeat_count": 1}
  ],
  "counts_by_service": {"mailer": 1}
}
```

Rules:
- Include only entries whose level is ERROR, SEVERE or FATAL (any capitalisation). Do not include other levels.
- `timestamp_utc` is the entry time converted to UTC, formatted `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.
- `level` is written in upper case. `message` is the text after the last ` | ` separator on the first line of the entry.
- `repeat_count` is 1 plus the sum of N from the `-- last message repeated N times --` lines that follow the entry (after its extra lines, if any).
- `counts_by_service` is the sum of `repeat_count` per service.

Your output file is also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme log-triage conventions.
When you are done, reply with a short summary of how you parsed the file.
